Predictive-Modeling-using-R
The loan prediction project focuses on developing a predictive model to determine loan approval status based on customer attributes such as income, credit history, and property area. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 10,439 rows and 12 columns, with "Loan_Status" as the target variable. Various visualizations highlight key insights, such as a higher loan approval rate overall, the impact of credit history on approval likelihood, and differences in loan amounts across property areas. The analysis also explores relationships between applicant income and loan amounts, revealing a right-skewed distribution with most loans falling in the 100â€“200 unit range. The model was developed using logistic regression, achieving a reliable accuracy and AUC-ROC score. However, recommendations include improving data quality, experimenting with advanced algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, and automating the data preprocessing pipeline to enhance predictive performance. Future work suggests incorporating additional features for better accuracy and refining loan policies based on insights derived from the analysis.
